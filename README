Can be compiled using g++-4.7
or as I now figured out with clang++.
Using latest clang++ (with the full c++11 support)
and self compiled libc++ from svn.

If you want to compile using g++-4.7:
remove -lc++ -stdlib=libc++ and replace -pthread with -lpthread in the
Makefile.
ofcourse replace clang++ with g++-4.7 or the name that implies g++-4.7 or
greater.
