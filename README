Projects idea is to provide a thread pool which handles jobs when given to the pool. Pool expects the job to be reasonably heavy to ensure good performance. Jobs are also expected to know better what memory they can access and what they can't, the threads are not interested about those and will just run the function as is.

Should compile on a linux with g++/clang with c++11 support. Or with some tweaks, on windows and mac.

Additional notes:
  Please use modern compiler, g++-4.8 or so. I fear g++-4.7 produces faulty assembler code for lambda and thread which results in segfault when using more than -O0 optimization level.
  Clang currently doesnt work...
